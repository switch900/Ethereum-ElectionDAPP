The Ultimate Ethereum Dapp Tutorial (How to Build a Full Stack Decentralized Application Step-By-Step)<br>
By Gregory McCubbin · November 25, 2020<br>
<br>
Hey everybody, it’s Gregory from Dapp University!<br>
<br>
Today I'm going to show you how to build your first decentralized application, or dApp, on the Ethereum blockchain. I'll show you how to write your first Ethereum smart contract, where we'll hold an election between two candidates. We'll write tests against the smart contract, deploy it to the Ethereum blockchain, and develop a client-side application that allows accounts to cast votes. We'll also examine key concepts like "what is a blockchain?", "what is a smart contract?", and "how does a dApp work?".
